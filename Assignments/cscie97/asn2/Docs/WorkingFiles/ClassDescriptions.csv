"House","","Implements ConfigurationItem.
Root node of a House Mate configuration. All objects within a configuration, are related to a single house.
"
"ConfigurationItem","House","Common Interface for items in the model. Defines methods that are used to identify items and store/retrieve state descriptions. Very central to the design, each realizing class implements a ""getFqn()"" method. An FQN (Fully Qualified Name) is a derived identifier that makes an ConfigurationItem unique within the system."
"Room","","Room within a house configuration.
Implements ConfigurationItem."
"Device","","Implements HMConfigurationItem.

Smart 'Device' within a home configuration. A device supports a collection of ""DeviceStates"" which are of two subtypes: Setting and Measure. A device that supports ""Settings"" can be considered an Appliance and a device that supports ""Measures"" can be considered a Sensor. A device can support both Measures and Settings, in which case it might be considered an Appliance, but technically it's just a Device that BOTH measures/detects things in its environment and is also takes commands to perform actions.

While there is no explicit Sensor and Appliance classes, this property could be derived by whether a Device has any ""Settings"" as features."
"Occupant","","Implements ConfigurationItem.
An Occupant within the system. Occupants are of various subtypes, which can be entitled to different interactions with the HouseMate System."

"Setting","","Subclass of DeviceState, implements ConfigurationItem. That represents controllable ""State"" of a Device - effectively making it a controllable Appliance.
The key difference from sibling subclass ""Measure"" is in the implemntation of ""saveState()"" it uses a different predicate to represent the fact that its a setting."
"DeviceState","","Implements ConfigurationItem.
Abstract class representing states that can be managed by Devices in the system. There are two concrete subclasses: Setting and Measure - settings allow for devices to be controlled and Measures allow for Devices to collect facts about things they measure. The available DeviceStates are stored in the House Mate System being deployed, and can be shared across Devices in different houses."

An association class representing the availablility of a DeviceState on a Device. It holds the state 'value' of DeviceState on that Device. For example, if a thermometer Device measures ""temperature"", that thermometer Device object has a Feature that has the temperature Measure object as its device state. The current value of the temperature Measure for that thermometer Device would be stored in the Feature object."
